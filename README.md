## About project

Poster store design. The application was to be integrated with shopify API.<br>
I started building the front end first because the client wanted to replicate the behavior of the full page plugin but wanted to customize it to his needs.<br>
I decided to write everything from scratch. Front end is almost ready for mobile devices.

Custom scroll works only on mobile devices so to test it remember to turn on mobile dev tools to simulate moving the page with your finger. <br>You can also run the page on your phone.

The project was abandoned due to legal issues with the posters sold by the client. <br><br>
The project will be relaunched, the posters will be replaced by free placeholders, the mobile view will be finished and the whole desktop view will be created. Shoplify integration will also be done.
<br>The project will be finished because I want to use it in my thesis.
